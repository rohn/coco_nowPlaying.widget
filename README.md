Ubersicht CoCo Now Playing widget
=================================

Using Ubersicht displays current track playing at CoCoMpls Downtown on your desktop.

## to use
Drop this entire repo into your Ubersicht widgets folder.

### setup
You'll need to have a last.fm api key, which you can acquire from http://www.last.fm/api
Plug that key into the first line of the index.coffee file and then you should be ready to go

## more info
I took inspiration from http://beautifulblood.deviantart.com/art/Unnamed-255040591

The widget is meant to blend into the black bevel of the MacBook Pro retina display but
should still look great on MacBook Airs as well.
